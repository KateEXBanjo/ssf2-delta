SSF2 Delta v1.2 - Change Log?

WARNING: PLEASE TURN ON WORD WRAP OR ELSE YOU'LL SEE VERY LONG LINES

Hey again, it's David.

It's been a really long time, huh? Almost a whole year. I honestly could've done a better job of keeping people up to date with what's been going on with me, or at least the project (since that's what most people were here for in the first place lol). If you're new here, then welcome! Hope you enjoy the mod. For everyone who was here before, though, as usual, I have some explaining to do...

~Where were you?~
I was honestly just living my life, doing other things. I did a *ton* of growing up and learning this year, leading to what's possibly been the best year of my life so far. Nothing's really been the same since the incident in late September 2020, but I'd say that it's been for the better for me. I've been much happier and have since learned how to take care of myself, communicate when something's going wrong, and really, things have just *never* gotten to that extreme level. I don't even have fears of returning to that place, as I've since learned when to step away, decompress, and come back. For the longest time I tried to brute force through the difficulties in my life, which is REALLY the wrong way to go about handling problems. Nowadays I try to take things at my own pace but step up when it's necessary. I faced a lot of my fears this year, but for the first time, I faced them the RIGHT way. Even if I was highly stressed out at the time, I'm still really proud that I managed to take those steps and get through it without it being the end of the world like it would've been prior.

So, basically, I didn't have much time to constantly work on this mod since I ended up doing a ton of personal development this year. No time for working with dead programming languages when I'm trying to be a better person! Though, that's not to say that things were perfect.I obviously still had moments of high stress or even "going off" on someone, but it's been entirely reduced to a normal-person level rather than whatever the hell I was doing in 2020 whenever I was upset. If shit happens nowadays I tend to explain that I'm upset and then just block 'em, or I'll step away for a bit, calm down, and return to things with a clear mind so I can resolve whatever the issue was. So, y'know, normal person shit. This has been so much less destructive and much more productive for myself and everyone else involved, and it's infinitely better than what used to be "the alternative".

As for what I'm doing nowadays, uh... well, I'm pretty busy. I finally landed a job that's directly related to my career path, so I'm taking that first step towards *following my dreams*, which is pretty rad. I've gotten into some video games and other things I never would've thought to try before. Who knows? I've even been thinking about watching TV and anime again (i'm tired of being a social outsider!!! but also there's some pretty cool stuff on streaming nowadays).

~What's next for Delta?~
Again, I dunno. I actually had fun working on this update throughout the year, though towards the end I kinda lost interest and never finished the release video, which is why I'm just alerting people haphazardly. Whenever a new SSF2 update comes out, I usually get motivated to work on Delta for a short period of time to keep up and at least make sure people can still play online. But my days of trying to predict the future are OVER. You'll hear from me when you hear from me.

Happy New Year's, and have a blessed 2022. You deserve it.
